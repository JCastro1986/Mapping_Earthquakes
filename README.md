# Mapping_Earthquakes.
Created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay
See the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

### Purpose
- The purpose of this challenge is to be able to obtain data on the last earthquakes that occurred in the world.
- As well I need to be able to visualize it using the javascript library with different types of maps.
- The maps layers will be able to be selected by the user, this will give a plus to the customer experience. 

The Maps all contained infrmation on:

- Earthquakes.
- Tectonic Plates.
- Major Earthquakes

An all the maps can be view in:
